## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project where we apply the **Random Forest Regression** model to predict student performance based on features such as study hours, sleep hours, attendance, and socioeconomic status. The project explores how different factors influence student grades, using the power of ensemble learning to create an accurate model for predicting academic outcomes.

The model we build leverages Random Forest, an ensemble method that aggregates multiple decision trees to make predictions. This approach not only improves accuracy but also reduces the risk of overfitting compared to individual decision trees.

Our goal is to predict student grades with as much accuracy as possible by analyzing and learning from the relationships between various features and the target variable (Grades). By using this model, educators and researchers can better understand the factors that most impact student success and make more data-driven decisions in educational contexts.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to predict student performance using a Random Forest Regression model. We aim to:

1. **Understand the data**: By exploring various features that may influence student grades, such as study hours, sleep hours, attendance, and socioeconomic status.
2. **Build an accurate predictive model**: Using Random Forest Regression, we train the model to predict student performance based on the available features.
3. **Evaluate the model**: Assess the model's performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score to ensure it provides reliable predictions.
4. **Visualize the results**: Plotting actual vs predicted values, residuals, and other performance metrics to gain insights into how well the model is performing.

This code serves as a guide to applying Random Forest Regression in predicting continuous outcomes like student grades, and showcases practical steps in building and evaluating machine learning models.
